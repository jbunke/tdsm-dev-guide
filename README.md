# *Top Down Sprite Maker* | Sprite Style Development Guide

Welcome to the *Top Down Sprite Maker* sprite style development guide!

This resource in intended to be a repository of links, files and guides to help you get comfortable making sprite styles for *Top Down Sprite Maker*. If you aren't familiar with the program or what a "sprite style" is, please check out [the *TDSM* store page on Itch.io](https://flinkerflitzer.itch.io/tdsm) and come back.

This is a live resource. It will be updated over time with more examples and guides.

## Overview

Sprite styles are packaged as ZIP files that contain a script file called `manifest.tds` that defines the rules for the sprite style, as well as any art files and help files called by `manifest.tds`.

### *DeltaScript*

*TDSM* uses *DeltaScript* as its scripting language. *DeltaScript* is a simple scripting language I developed with a C-style syntax (curly braces, semicolon statement terminators, etc.).

## Tutorial video

This tutorial is the best way to get started and get a taste of what's possible for your sprite style. It is a step-by-step guide that shows you the entire process of producing a `manifest.tds` script file. This tutorial - and the guide - are **not** a pixel art crash course. The material makes the assumption that you are already a competent pixel artist, or at least have access to art you are ready to turn into a sprite style.

The material to follow along with the tutorial can be found in the `tutorial-contents` folder.

> The tutorial video has chapters and numerous resource links in the video description, so consider watching it directly on YouTube.
